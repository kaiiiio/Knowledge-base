# GitHub Actions — Deep Dive

## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a **CI/CD platform integrated into GitHub** that automates workflows.

**Key Features**:
* YAML-based configuration
* Runs on GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runners
* Marketplace with 10,000+ pre-built actions
* Free tier for public repos

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. Workflow
A YAML file that defines automation (`.github/workflows/*.yml`)

### 2. Event
Triggers that start a workflow (push, pull_request, schedule, etc.)

### 3. Job
A set of steps that run on the same runner

### 4. Step
Individual task (run command, use action)

### 5. Runner
Server that executes workflows (ubuntu, windows, macos)

### 6. Action
Reusable unit of code (from marketplace or custom)

## Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: Workflow Name

on: [push, pull_request]  # Events

jobs:
  job-name:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Runner
    
    steps:
      - name: Step 1
        uses: actions/checkout@v3  # Action
      
      - name: Step 2
        run: npm install  # Command
```

---

## Common Events (Triggers)

```yaml
# On push to main
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

# On pull request
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

# On schedule (cron)
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Daily at midnight

# Manual trigger
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

# Multiple events
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:
```

## Complete CI/CD Example

**.github/workflows/deploy.yml**

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

env:
  NODE_VERSION: '18'
  DOCKER_IMAGE: my-app

jobs:
  # Job 1: Test
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
          cache: 'npm'
      
      - name: Install dependencies

## Advanced Patterns

### Matrix Strategy (Test Multiple Versions)

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
        node-version: [16, 18, 20]
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - run: npm test
```

### Conditional Steps

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Deploy to staging
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
    run: deploy-staging.sh
  
  - name: Deploy to production
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    run: deploy-production.sh
```

### Reusable Workflows

**.github/workflows/reusable-deploy.yml**
```yaml
name: Reusable Deploy

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      environment:
        required: true
        type: string

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying to ${{ inputs.environment }}"
```

**Use it:**
```yaml
jobs:
  deploy-staging:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-deploy.yml
    with:
      environment: staging
```

### Artifacts (Share Files Between Jobs)

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-files
          path: dist/
  
  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-files
      - run: deploy.sh
```

---

## Secrets Management

### Add Secrets
1. Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
2. Click **New repository secret**
3. Add name and value

### Use in Workflow
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Use secret
    env:
      API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
    run: echo "Secret is set"
```

---

## Caching Dependencies

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  
  - name: Cache node modules
    uses: actions/cache@v3
    with:
      path: ~/.npm
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
      restore-keys: |
        ${{ runner.os }}-node-
  
  - run: npm ci
```

---

## Environment Variables

### Workflow-level
```yaml
env:
  NODE_ENV: production

jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      - run: echo $NODE_ENV
```

### Job-level
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    env:
      BUILD_TYPE: release
    steps:
      - run: echo $BUILD_TYPE
```

### Step-level
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Build
    env:
      API_URL: https://api.example.com
    run: npm run build
```

---

## Self-Hosted Runners

For private infrastructure:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted  # Use your own server
    steps:
      - run: ./deploy.sh
```

**Setup**:
1. Go to **Settings → Actions → Runners**
2. Click **New self-hosted runner**
3. Follow instructions to install on your server

---

## Common Actions from Marketplace

```yaml
# Checkout code
- uses: actions/checkout@v3

# Setup Node.js
- uses: actions/setup-node@v3
  with:
    node-version: '18'

# Setup Python
- uses: actions/setup-python@v4
  with:
    python-version: '3.11'

# Docker build and push
- uses: docker/build-push-action@v4

# Deploy to AWS
- uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2

# Slack notification
- uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3

# Create GitHub release
- uses: actions/create-release@v1
```

---

## Debugging Workflows

### Enable Debug Logging
Add secrets:
- `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` = `true`
- `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG` = `true`

### SSH into Runner (for debugging)
```yaml
- name: Setup tmate session
  uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3
```

---

## Best Practices

✅ **Use specific action versions** (`@v3`, not `@main`)
✅ **Cache dependencies** to speed up builds
✅ **Use matrix for multi-version testing**
✅ **Fail fast** with `fail-fast: true`
✅ **Use secrets** for sensitive data
✅ **Add status badges** to README
✅ **Use reusable workflows** for common tasks

❌ Don't commit secrets
❌ Don't use `latest` tags
❌ Don't run untrusted code

---

## Status Badge

Add to README.md:
```markdown
![CI](https://github.com/username/repo/workflows/CI/badge.svg)
```

## Interview Questions

**Q: What is the difference between `runs-on` and `uses`?**
A: `runs-on` specifies the runner OS. `uses` imports a pre-built action.

**Q: How do you share data between jobs?**
A: Use artifacts (`upload-artifact` and `download-artifact`).

**Q: What is the difference between `on: push` and `on: pull_request`?**
A: `push` triggers on commits to branches. `pull_request` triggers when PRs are opened/updated.

**Q: How do you prevent secrets from being exposed in logs?**
A: GitHub automatically masks secrets in logs. Never `echo` secrets directly.

## Summary

| Feature | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Workflow** | Automation definition |
| **Event** | Trigger (push, PR, schedule) |
| **Job** | Group of steps |
| **Step** | Individual task |
| **Action** | Reusable code |
| **Secret** | Sensitive data |

**Key Insight**: GitHub Actions makes CI/CD accessible with minimal setup and deep GitHub integration.
