## 💡 Key Takeaways by Topic

### Caching & Queues
- Redis is not just a cache (sessions, queues, locks)
- Use queues for async processing (BullMQ for Node.js)
- RabbitMQ for microservices, Kafka for event streaming

### Docker & Deployment
- Docker solves "works on my machine"
- NGINX handles SSL, load balancing, static files
- PM2 for simple apps, Docker for production, K8s for scale

### CI/CD
- Automate testing and deployment
- GitHub Actions for simplicity, Jenkins for custom needs
- Implement blue-green or canary deployments

### Production
- Design for failure (retries, timeouts, circuit breakers)
- Monitor everything (Prometheus + Grafana)
- Senior engineers prevent outages, not just fix them

## 📊 Technology Decision Matrix

### Choose Redis when:
✅ Need caching, sessions, or simple queues
✅ Already using Node.js
✅ Want fast in-memory storage

### Choose RabbitMQ when:
✅ Microservices communication
✅ Need complex routing
✅ Multi-language systems

### Choose Kafka when:
✅ Event streaming
✅ Need event replay
✅ High throughput (>100k/sec)

### Choose Docker when:
✅ Need isolation
✅ Multi-environment deployments
✅ Standard for production

### Choose Kubernetes when:
✅ Microservices at scale
✅ Auto-scaling needed
✅ High availability required
