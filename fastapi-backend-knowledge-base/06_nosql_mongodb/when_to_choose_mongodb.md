# When to Choose MongoDB: Decision Guide

MongoDB is a document database that stores data as JSON-like documents. This guide helps you understand when MongoDB is the right choice versus PostgreSQL or other databases.

## Understanding Document Databases

**What makes MongoDB different:** Stores documents (like JSON objects) instead of rows, flexible schema (documents can have different fields), no joins needed (related data can be embedded), and horizontal scaling is built-in.

**Think of it like this:** **PostgreSQL** is like Excel spreadsheets (rows, columns, fixed structure). **MongoDB** is like filing cabinets with folders (documents, flexible structure).

## When MongoDB Shines

### Use Case 1: Flexible, Evolving Schemas

**The problem with relational databases:** Every new field requires a migration, altering tables, and potential downtime.

**MongoDB solution:** Just add the field to new documents - no schema changes needed.

**Example - User profiles:**
```python
# User 1: Basic profile
{
    "_id": ObjectId("..."),
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "name": "John Doe"
}

# User 2: Extended profile (different fields!)
{
    "_id": ObjectId("..."),
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "bio": "Software developer",
    "social_links": {
        "twitter": "@jane",
        "github": "janesmith"
    },
    "preferences": {
        "theme": "dark",
        "notifications": ["email", "push"]
    }
}

# Both in the same collection - MongoDB doesn't care!
```

**When this matters:** Rapid prototyping, frequently changing requirements, user-generated content with varying fields, and content management systems.

### Use Case 2: Document Embedding (No Joins)

**PostgreSQL approach:**
```sql
-- Multiple tables
users table
  id | email
  1  | john@example.com

user_profiles table
  user_id | bio | phone
  1       | ... | ...

user_addresses table
  user_id | street | city
  1       | ...    | ...

-- Requires JOINs to get complete user
SELECT * FROM users u
JOIN user_profiles p ON u.id = p.user_id
JOIN user_addresses a ON u.id = a.user_id
WHERE u.id = 1;
```

**MongoDB approach:**
```python
# Single document with everything embedded
{
    "_id": ObjectId("..."),
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "profile": {
        "bio": "...",
        "phone": "..."
    },
    "addresses": [
        {"street": "...", "city": "..."},
        {"street": "...", "city": "..."}
    ]
}

# One query gets everything: No joins needed (all data embedded).
user = await db.users.find_one({"_id": user_id})
# All data already there - no joins! (faster than SQL JOINs)
```

**When this helps:** Frequently reading complete objects, rarely need just part of the data, and simple relationships.

### Use Case 3: Content Management

**Example - Blog posts with comments:**

```python
# Single document with nested comments
{
    "_id": ObjectId("..."),
    "title": "Getting Started with FastAPI",
    "content": "...",
    "author": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john@example.com"
    },
    "tags": ["python", "fastapi", "web"],
    "comments": [
        {
            "author": "Jane",
            "text": "Great article!",
            "created_at": datetime.now(),
            "replies": [
                {"author": "John", "text": "Thanks!", ...}
            ]
        }
    ],
    "metadata": {
        "views": 1250,
        "likes": 42,
        "reading_time": 5
    }
}
```

**Benefits:** Single query gets post + all comments + author, easy to update (add comment = append to array), and natural document structure.

### Use Case 4: Horizontal Scaling

**MongoDB sharding:** Automatically distributes data across servers, built-in support for sharding, and handles massive datasets easily.

**PostgreSQL:** Sharding is complex (manual setup) and better for vertical scaling (bigger server).

**When MongoDB wins:** Need to scale beyond single server, millions/billions of documents, and high write throughput.

## When NOT to Use MongoDB

### ❌ Complex Relationships

**Problem:** MongoDB doesn't have joins. Complex relationships require multiple queries.

**Example - E-commerce orders:**
```python
# MongoDB: Need multiple queries
order = await db.orders.find_one({"_id": order_id})

# Get user separately
user = await db.users.find_one({"_id": order["user_id"]})

# Get each product separately (N queries!)
for item in order["items"]:
    product = await db.products.find_one({"_id": item["product_id"]})
```

**PostgreSQL:**
```sql
-- Single query with JOINs
SELECT o.*, u.*, p.*
FROM orders o
JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
WHERE o.id = 1;
```

**Use PostgreSQL when:** Many relationships between entities, need complex queries across tables, and referential integrity is critical.

### ❌ ACID Transactions Across Documents

**MongoDB limitations:**
- Multi-document transactions are possible but slower
- Complex transactions are not MongoDB's strength

**PostgreSQL:**
- ACID transactions are core feature
- Complex multi-table transactions work seamlessly

**Use PostgreSQL when:**
- Financial transactions
- Inventory management
- Critical data consistency requirements

### ❌ Complex Aggregations

**PostgreSQL advantage:**
- SQL is powerful for complex aggregations
- Window functions, CTEs, subqueries

**MongoDB:**
- Aggregation pipeline is powerful but different
- Some operations are more complex

## Decision Matrix

| Requirement | MongoDB ✅ | PostgreSQL ✅ |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| Flexible schema | ✅ Excellent | ❌ Rigid |
| Horizontal scaling | ✅ Built-in | ⚠️ Complex |
| Document embedding | ✅ Natural | ⚠️ JSONB possible |
| Complex relationships | ❌ No joins | ✅ Excellent |
| ACID transactions | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Excellent |
| Complex queries | ⚠️ Aggregation | ✅ SQL |
| Rapid prototyping | ✅ Perfect | ⚠️ Migrations needed |

## Real-World Examples

### ✅ Good MongoDB Use Cases

**1. User-Generated Content**
```python
# Blog posts, comments, profiles
# Structure varies per user
# Frequently read complete documents
```

**2. Product Catalogs (Simple)**
```python
# Products with varying attributes
# Electronics have different fields than books
# Rarely need complex relationships
```

**3. IoT Data**
```python
# Time-series data
# Device readings
# High write volume
```

**4. Content Management**
```python
# Articles, pages, media
# Nested structures (comments, replies)
# Frequently read whole documents
```

### ❌ Poor MongoDB Use Cases

**1. E-Commerce with Complex Orders**
- Many relationships (user, products, payments, shipping)
- Need transactions
- Complex reporting

**2. Financial Systems**
- Strict ACID requirements
- Complex relationships
- Audit trails

**3. Analytics/Reporting**
- Complex aggregations
- SQL is better suited
- Data warehouse integration

## Hybrid Approach

You can use both! Many successful systems use:
- **PostgreSQL**: Core structured data (users, orders, transactions)
- **MongoDB**: Flexible content (product catalogs, user-generated content, logs)

**Example architecture:**
```
┌─────────────┐
│   FastAPI   │
└──────┬──────┘
       │
   ┌───┴────┬──────────┐
   │        │          │
┌──▼──┐ ┌──▼───┐  ┌───▼──┐
│PostgreSQL│ │MongoDB │ │Redis │
│(Users,   │ │(Content│ │(Cache)│
│ Orders)  │ │, Logs) │ │      │
└──────────┘ └────────┘ └──────┘
```

## Making the Decision

**Choose MongoDB if:**
1. ✅ Schema changes frequently
2. ✅ Document-like data (nested, self-contained)
3. ✅ Need horizontal scaling
4. ✅ Simple relationships
5. ✅ High write volume
6. ✅ Rapid development

**Choose PostgreSQL if:**
1. ✅ Structured, stable schema
2. ✅ Complex relationships
3. ✅ Need ACID transactions
4. ✅ Complex queries/reporting
5. ✅ Referential integrity critical
6. ✅ Team knows SQL well

## Summary

MongoDB excels at:
- Flexible, evolving data structures
- Document-oriented data (nested, embedded)
- Horizontal scaling
- Rapid development

PostgreSQL excels at:
- Structured, relational data
- Complex relationships
- ACID transactions
- Complex queries

Choose based on your data structure and query patterns. Many applications benefit from using both!
