# 05. Reliability & Performance: Keeping it Alive

## 1. The "Zombie Connection" Problem

TCP connections can die silently. A router reboots, a mobile phone switches from Wi-Fi to 4G, or the cable is pulled. In these cases, no FIN packet is sent. The server thinks the client is connected. The client thinks the server is connected. Both are waiting forever.

### The Solution: Application-Level Heartbeats

Don't rely on TCP Keepalive (it's too slow, default 2 hours). Implement your own: **Server** sends `{"type": "ping"}` every 30 seconds. **Client** must reply `{"type": "pong"}` within 10 seconds. If no Pong? Kill the connection.

```python
# Server-side heartbeat: Send ping every 30 seconds to detect dead connections.
async def heartbeat(websocket):
    while True:
        await asyncio.sleep(30)  # Wait 30 seconds between pings
        try:
            # Send ping: Client must respond with pong.
            await websocket.send_json({"type": "ping"})
            # Wait for pong logic here (complex to implement in single loop): Use separate task to track pong timeout.
        except:
            break  # Connection closed, exit heartbeat loop
```

*Note: Browsers handle standard Ping frames automatically, but you can't access them in JS. JSON-based ping/pong is easier to debug.*

## 2. Backpressure: When the Client is Slow

Imagine your server produces 1000 messages/sec. The client is on a 2G network and can only read 10 messages/sec. **What happens?** The server's memory buffer fills up. RAM usage spikes. Eventually, the server crashes (OOM).

### The Solution: **Detect slow clients** by checking `websocket.client_state`. **Drop messages** if the queue is full, drop the oldest messages (QoS 0). **Disconnect** if a client is too slow, kick them off.

## 3. Nginx / Load Balancer Configuration

If you put Nginx in front of FastAPI (you should), you need specific config. Nginx doesn't proxy WebSockets by default.

```nginx
# WebSocket proxy configuration: Enable WebSocket upgrade headers.
location /ws/ {
    proxy_pass http://backend;  # Backend FastAPI server
    proxy_http_version 1.1;  # HTTP/1.1 required for WebSocket upgrade
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;  # Upgrade header for WebSocket
    proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";  # Connection: Upgrade
    proxy_set_header Host $host;  # Preserve original host
}
```

### Timeouts: Nginx kills idle connections after 60 seconds (`proxy_read_timeout`). If your Heartbeat is 30s, this is fine. If your Heartbeat is 5 minutes, Nginx will kill your users. Set `proxy_read_timeout` to slightly higher than your heartbeat interval.

## 4. AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)

ALB supports WebSockets natively. **Gotcha:** ALB has an idle timeout (default 60s). If no data flows, ALB sends a FIN. **Fix:** Ensure your Heartbeat runs faster than the ALB timeout.
