# 03. WebRTC Deep Dive: Breaking Through Firewalls

## 1. The Impossible Problem

Two computers want to talk. Computer A is behind a corporate firewall (NAT). Private IP: `192.168.1.5`. Computer B is on a home Wi-Fi (NAT). Private IP: `10.0.0.4`.

If A sends a packet to `10.0.0.4`, it hits a wall. It's a local address. WebRTC is the technology of NAT Traversal. It punches holes in firewalls.

## 2. ICE, STUN, and TURN: The Tools

### ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment)

The protocol that says: "Let's try every possible way to connect." It gathers candidates: **Host Candidate** is my local IP (`192.168.1.5`) - works if we are on the same Wi-Fi. **Srflx Candidate (Server Reflexive)** is my public IP (`203.45.x.x`) - found via STUN. **Relay Candidate** is the IP of a TURN server - the last resort.

### STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT)

A lightweight server. **Client** asks "Who am I?", **STUN Server** replies "You are 203.45.12.1:4500". **Cost:** Cheap/Free. Uses almost no bandwidth.

### TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT)

A heavy-duty relay. If P2P is blocked (Symmetric NATs, strict firewalls), traffic goes Client A → TURN → Client B. **Cost:** Expensive. You pay for bandwidth (video is heavy!). **Reality:** Needed for ~15-20% of mobile connections.

## 3. The Signaling State Machine

The "Offer/Answer" dance is strict. You can't just send data whenever.

**The Perfect Negotiation:** **Stable State** - both peers are idle. **Peer A (Offerer)** - `createOffer()`, `setLocalDescription(offer)`, send Offer to B via Signaling Server (FastAPI). **Peer B (Answerer)** - receive Offer, `setRemoteDescription(offer)`, `createAnswer()`, `setLocalDescription(answer)`, send Answer to A. **Peer A** - receive Answer, `setRemoteDescription(answer)`. **Stable State** - connection opens.

**Race Conditions (Glare):** What if A and B both try to call each other at the exact same millisecond? Both send Offers, both receive Offers while in "Have Local Offer" state, and crash. **Solution:** "Polite Peer" pattern. One peer is designated "Polite" (it rolls back its own offer if a collision happens). The other is "Impolite" (it ignores incoming offers if busy).

## 4. FastAPI Implementation: Robust Signaling

The previous example was a simple pipe. A robust server needs to handle **User Presence**.

```python
# A robust Connection Manager
class ConnectionManager:
    def __init__(self):
        # user_id -> WebSocket
        self.active_connections: Dict[str, WebSocket] = {}
        # user_id -> status ("online", "busy")
        self.user_status: Dict[str, str] = {}

    async def connect(self, user_id: str, websocket: WebSocket):
        await websocket.accept()
        self.active_connections[user_id] = websocket
        self.user_status[user_id] = "online"

    def disconnect(self, user_id: str):
        if user_id in self.active_connections:
            del self.active_connections[user_id]
        if user_id in self.user_status:
            del self.user_status[user_id]

    # send_signal: Forward WebRTC signaling messages (offer/answer/ICE candidates).
    async def send_signal(self, sender_id: str, target_id: str, data: dict):
        if target_id not in self.active_connections:
            # Inform sender that target is offline: User not connected.
            await self.active_connections[sender_id].send_json({"type": "error", "message": "User offline"})
            return

        # Forward the SDP/ICE payload: Relay signaling data between peers.
        payload = {
            "sender": sender_id,
            **data  # contains 'type': 'offer'/'answer'/'candidate', 'sdp': ...
        }
        await self.active_connections[target_id].send_json(payload)  # Send to target peer
```

### Security Note
The Signaling Server sees *everything* during the handshake. However, the actual media (Video/Audio) is encrypted end-to-end (DTLS-SRTP). The server *cannot* spy on the video stream unless it acts as a Man-in-the-Middle TURN server (which you control anyway).
