// The Challenge: You are building "Twitter". You need to implement the Timeline (News Feed).

// The Constraints:

// User A follows User B.

// When User B tweets, it must show up in User A's feed.

// User B is a celebrity (Justin Bieber) with 100 Million followers.

// The Question: If Justin Bieber tweets, and you try to insert that tweet into 100 Million users' timeline databases individually... your database will explode. It will take hours to update everyone.

// How do you architect this efficiently?
