## 📝 Quick Reference

### Database Selection
| Use Case | Database | Reason |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Transactions | PostgreSQL | ACID guarantees |
| Flexible Schema | MongoDB | Document model |
| Caching | Redis | In-memory speed |
| Search | Elasticsearch | Full-text search |
| Time-series | InfluxDB | Optimized for metrics |

### When to Use What

**Message Queue vs Database**
- Use Queue: Async processing, decoupling services
- Use Database: Persistent storage, complex queries

**SQL vs NoSQL**
- Use SQL: Structured data, complex joins, transactions
- Use NoSQL: Flexible schema, horizontal scaling, high write throughput

**Caching Strategy**
- Cache-Aside: Read-heavy workloads
- Write-Through: Write-heavy, consistency important
- Write-Behind: High write throughput, eventual consistency OK
